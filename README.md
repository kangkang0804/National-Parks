##Why the project is useful?
We were Motivated to create this application after our own personal experiences, and recognize this is an epidemic among Navigation resources.

An Example: Reddit thread posted 11 months ago which reads…
“Navigation via landmarks is only possible with verifiable and trusted POI (point of interest) data. Fake or incorrect listings could cause major problems in a system like this.”

This results in navigation systems providing users with locations that doesn’t match.
Or are far beyond their route / location.

We were motivated to make navigation via landmarks and National Parks possible by…
Utilizing National Parks API to read accurate point of interest data.
Accessing search query parameters and arrays to set markers at waypoints.

###How users can get started with the project.
The Application has been designed to provide the user to:
Have the user search the state they want to go to from the list
Have them choose a park in that state by clicking on the marker
Navigate from their current position to that park
Ask for stops along the way (per the current method)
